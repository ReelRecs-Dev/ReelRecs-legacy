# COMP-541 Data Mining Project: Movie Recommendation System (Legacy Code)

## Overview
This repository contains the legacy code for the final project of the COMP 541 Data Mining course at California State University Northridge, completed during the Fall 2023 semester. This project was developed by Group 3, consisting of Carlos Figueroa, Gisela Calva, Melissa Little, Patrick Horton, Ruknuddin Asrari, Zori Badkerhanian, and Yousuf Mohammed under the guidance of Dr. Taehyung ("George") Wang.

## Project Description
The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering techniques. This system analyzed user-specific data such as viewing history, preferences, and demographic information to generate personalized movie suggestions. The project utilized the MovieLens dataset, applying various data preprocessing and modeling techniques to achieve its objectives.

## Legacy Status and Relevance
This repository serves as the base for the advanced ReelRecs project, a revamped version that extends the capabilities of this initial movie recommendation system. The legacy code here represents the foundational work that has been built upon with additional features such as dual recommendation systems (personalized and popularity-based), a data pipeline using Google Cloud Dataflow, and enhanced machine learning techniques including Matrix Factorization and NLP-based content filtering.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data preprocessing and analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
