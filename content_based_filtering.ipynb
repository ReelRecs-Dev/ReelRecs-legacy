    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "- **NumPy (np):** NumPy is a widely-used library in Python for numerical and mathematical operations. It provides support for working with arrays and matrices, making it essential for scientific and data analysis tasks.\n",
    "- **NumPy Masked Array (ma):** NumPy's Masked Array module is used for handling arrays with missing or masked data. It allows you to work with data that may contain invalid or missing values without raising errors.\n",
    "- **genfromtxt:** This is a function provided by NumPy for reading data from text files and creating NumPy arrays from the data. It's particularly useful for loading data from CSV files and other text-based formats.\n",
    "- **collections.defaultdict:** The defaultdict class from the collections module is a specialized dictionary-like data structure that provides default values for missing keys. It's useful for various data manipulation tasks, such as counting occurrences.\n",
    "- **Pandas (pd):** Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures like DataFrames and Series, making it easier to work with structured data.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow (tf):** TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's widely used for building and training deep learning models, including neural networks.\n",
    "- **Keras:** Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow (or other backend engines). It provides a user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "- **StandardScaler:** StandardScaler is a preprocessing technique provided by scikit-learn (sklearn) for standardizing features in your data. It removes the mean and scales features to have unit variance.\n",
    "- **MinMaxScaler:** MinMaxScaler, also from scikit-learn, is used to scale features to a specified range, commonly [0, 1]. It's helpful when you want to normalize your data to a specific interval.\n",
    "- **train_test_split:** This function, available in scikit-learn, is used to split your dataset into separate training and testing sets. It's a crucial step in machine learning for evaluating model performance.\n",
    "- **tabulate:** Tabulate is a Python library for neatly formatting and pretty-printing tabular data. It helps make data presentation more readable and user-friendly.\n",
    "- **pd.set_option(\"display.precision\", 1):** This line of code configures the Pandas library to display floating-point numbers with a precision of one decimal place by default. It affects how data is presented when you print or display Pandas DataFrames or Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminal Instructions:\n",
    "1. go to jupyter notebook directory \n",
    "2. run 'pip install --upgrade numpy scipy' \n",
    "4. Restart Kernel if needed."

    "1. **Collect User Ratings:** You start by gathering the ratings provided by a user for various movies. Each rating reflects how much the user liked a specific movie.\n",
    "2. **Encode Movie Genres:** You have a dataset that lists the genres associated with each movie with binary classification. For each movie the user has rated, you find the genres it belongs to and mark those genres as \"rated\" by the user. Next, for each movie the user has rated, the genres associated with that movie will be that rating. Do this for all movies the user has rated.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Genre Ratings:** For each genre, you sum up the ratings given by the user to all the movies that belong to that genre. This gives you the total rating the user has given to all movies within each genre.\n",
    "4. **Average Genre Ratings:** To create a more balanced view, you calculate the average rating for each genre by dividing the total genre rating by the number of movies the user has rated within that genre. This helps account for cases where the user may have rated more or fewer movies in certain genres.\n",
    "5. **Non-Scaled User Profile:** The result of these calculations is a non-scaled user profile. It represents the average ratings the user has given to different movie genres based on their past ratings. This user profile helps identify the user's preferences and can be used for various purposes, such as recommending movies of similar genres that align with their tastes.\n",
