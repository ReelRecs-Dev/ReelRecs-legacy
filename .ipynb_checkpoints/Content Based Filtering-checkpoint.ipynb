    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "- **NumPy (np):** NumPy is a widely-used library in Python for numerical and mathematical operations. It provides support for working with arrays and matrices, making it essential for scientific and data analysis tasks.\n",
    "- **NumPy Masked Array (ma):** NumPy's Masked Array module is used for handling arrays with missing or masked data. It allows you to work with data that may contain invalid or missing values without raising errors.\n",
    "- **genfromtxt:** This is a function provided by NumPy for reading data from text files and creating NumPy arrays from the data. It's particularly useful for loading data from CSV files and other text-based formats.\n",
    "- **collections.defaultdict:** The defaultdict class from the collections module is a specialized dictionary-like data structure that provides default values for missing keys. It's useful for various data manipulation tasks, such as counting occurrences.\n",
    "- **Pandas (pd):** Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures like DataFrames and Series, making it easier to work with structured data.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow (tf):** TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's widely used for building and training deep learning models, including neural networks.\n",
    "- **Keras:** Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow (or other backend engines). It provides a user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "- **StandardScaler:** StandardScaler is a preprocessing technique provided by scikit-learn (sklearn) for standardizing features in your data. It removes the mean and scales features to have unit variance.\n",
    "- **MinMaxScaler:** MinMaxScaler, also from scikit-learn, is used to scale features to a specified range, commonly [0, 1]. It's helpful when you want to normalize your data to a specific interval.\n",
    "- **train_test_split:** This function, available in scikit-learn, is used to split your dataset into separate training and testing sets. It's a crucial step in machine learning for evaluating model performance.\n",
    "- **tabulate:** Tabulate is a Python library for neatly formatting and pretty-printing tabular data. It helps make data presentation more readable and user-friendly.\n",
    "- **pd.set_option(\"display.precision\", 1):** This line of code configures the Pandas library to display floating-point numbers with a precision of one decimal place by default. It affects how data is presented when you print or display Pandas DataFrames or Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminal Instructions:\n",
    "1. go to jupyter notebook directory \n",
    "2. run 'pip install tensorflow'\n",
    "3. run 'pip install --upgrade numpy scipy' \n",
    "4. Restart Kernel if needed."
